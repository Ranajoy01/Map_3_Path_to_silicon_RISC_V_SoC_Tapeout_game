## :book: Introduction to System on Chip (SoC) 

### :bulb: Computer system overview
   - :zap: Any computing system has some basic functions and some specialized functions.
      - `Basic functions` are processing , storage, Synchronization managemnet (clock), peripheral interface management , power management.
      - `Specialized functions` communication interface, secure data management, image/video/audio processing.

   - :zap: Generally for high performance computing (Desktop computer) different chips or different hardware blocks are separate entities, these are connected together through wires.

### :bulb: System on Chip (SoC) overview

  Here, most or all components of a `computer system`  are integrated into a `single chip`.Basic SoC is made by integating processor, memory, peripheral interface, clock management, power management block onto a silicon die. Others hardware blocks can be integrated into the chip for specialized function. It is used to improve performance, reduce power consumption and physical space.

### :white_check_mark: SoC advantages
   - Reduce requirements of external ICs.
   - Smaller physical size and compact design.
   - Power efficient.
   - On chip communcation and less signal delay produce higher performance.
   - Cost effective as high-volume manufacturing lowers the cost.
   - Optimized for specific application.
---
### :warning: SoC disadvantages
   - Design become very complex.
   - Heat Dissipation issue is a very big problem in SoC.
   - Different `level of power supplies` to different hardware blocks is problematic.
   - No upgradability.
   - If any failure occurs in any block of SoC, it will affect the whole system and replacement of the SoC is the only option to solve this issue.
---
### :bulb: SoC application
   - Smartphones: Qualcomm Snapdragon.
   - Communication device: SoC in wifi router.
   - Automobile: Car infotainment control.
   - Industrial control systems.
   - Aerospace and defense.
   - Wearables and IoT systems: Smart watch, Amazon alexa.
   - AI and Edge computing.
   - Robotics.
   - Consumer electronics: Smart TV.
