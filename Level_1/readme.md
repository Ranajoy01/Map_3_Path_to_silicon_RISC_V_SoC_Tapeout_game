## :book: Introduction to System on Chip (SoC) 

### :bulb: Computer system overview
  :zap: Any computing system has some basic functions and some specialized functions.
      - `Basic functions` are processing , storage, Synchronization managemnet (clock), peripheral interface management , power management.
      - `Specialized functions` communication interface, secure data management, image/video/audio processing.

  :zap: Generally for high performance computing (Desktop computer) different chips or different hardware blocks are separate entities, these are connected together through wires.

### :bulb: System on Chip (SoC) overview

  Here, most or all components of a `computer system`  are integrated into a `single chip`.Basic SoC is made by integating processor, memory, peripheral interface, clock management, power management block onto a silicon die. Others hardware blocks can be integrated into the chip for specialized function. It is used to improve performance, reduce power consumption and physical space.

### :white_check_mark: SoC advantages
   - Reduce requirements of external ICs.
   - Smaller physical size and compact design.
   - Power efficient.
   - On chip communcation and less signal delay produce higher performance.

## :book: Instruction Set Architecure (ISA)

## :bulb: Introduction to ISA

 :zap: ISA is a very important part of processor design. 
 
 :zap: It is very crucial in hardware software interfacing. 

 :zap: It give the rules which combinations of N- bit for which instruction.(N word length)

 :zap: ARM V7 ISA (Mobile device), AMD X86 ISA (Desktop computer).

  :zap: RISC-V gives open source instruction set architecture. 

 

## :bulb: Importance of ISA

:zap: If different procesing unit has different ISA designed by different companies then complexity increase.

:zap: It is the low level interface of hardware-software. Compiler maps high level language instructions to these instructions.

:zap: Open source ISA gives the oppurtunity to design different cores with the same ISA.It ease the design process.
